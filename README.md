# delphi.nvim

A tasteful LLM plugin.

## Features

- Chat with your models directly inside Neovim.
- Use `@path/to/file` in a chat message to embed that file's contents as a fenced
  code block before sending it to the model.
- Optional nvim-cmp integration for convenient path completion in chat buffers
  (`chat.enable_cmp = true`).

WIP.
